# Infrastructure and Deployment Integration

### Existing Infrastructure

**Current Deployment:** Static site deployment via Vite build process
**Infrastructure Tools:** Vite build, npm scripts
**Environments:** Development (npm run dev), Production (npm run build)

### Enhancement Deployment Strategy

**Deployment Approach:** Standard Vite build with no infrastructure changes
**Infrastructure Changes:** None required - purely frontend enhancements
**Pipeline Integration:** Uses existing build pipeline without modifications

### Rollback Strategy

**Rollback Method:** Git revert to previous commit with component restoration
**Risk Mitigation:** Preserve removed components in separate branch during transition
**Monitoring:** Browser console monitoring for EmailJS service health
