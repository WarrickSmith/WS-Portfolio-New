# Introduction

This document outlines the architectural approach for enhancing WS-Portfolio-New with privacy-focused portfolio refactoring capabilities and visitor tracking functionality. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development of new features while ensuring seamless integration with the existing system.

**Relationship to Existing Architecture:**
This document supplements existing project architecture by defining how new components will integrate with current systems. Where conflicts arise between new and existing patterns, this document provides guidance on maintaining consistency while implementing enhancements.

## Existing Project Analysis

### Current Project State

- **Primary Purpose:** Personal portfolio showcasing technical skills and projects
