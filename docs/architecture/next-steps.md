# Next Steps

### Story Manager Handoff

The Portfolio Refactor enhancement is ready for story implementation. Key requirements:

- **Architecture Reference:** This document defines integration patterns with existing React/TypeScript/EmailJS system
- **Integration Requirements:** Maintain existing component structure while implementing privacy-focused changes
- **Existing System Constraints:** Zero budget, EmailJS free tier, preserve visual design and animations
- **First Story Priority:** Privacy Content Scrub (User Story 1) - lowest risk to existing system
- **Integration Checkpoints:** Verify each story maintains existing portfolio functionality

**Critical Success Factors:**

- Test visitor tracking without impacting existing contact form functionality
- Preserve all existing animations and styling during component modifications
- Ensure EmailJS service limits are not exceeded during implementation

### Developer Handoff

Implementation ready with validated brownfield architecture:

- **Architecture Foundation:** Existing React 18.2 + TypeScript + Vite + Styled Components + EmailJS stack
- **Integration Requirements:** Component modifications following existing patterns, EmailJS template extension
- **Technical Decisions:** Leverage existing EmailJS service, maintain component-based architecture, preserve styling approach
- **Compatibility Requirements:** Zero impact on existing portfolio functionality, maintain animation performance
- **Implementation Sequencing:**
  1. Privacy content scrub (lowest risk)
  2. Consolidated summary component (medium risk - component replacement)
  3. Visitor tracking integration (lowest risk - additive feature)
  4. Contact form verification (no changes - validation only)

**Verification Steps:**

- Test existing contact form functionality after each implementation phase
- Verify all existing animations and responsive behavior remain intact
- Confirm EmailJS service integration maintains existing template functionality
- Validate visitor tracking respects privacy requirements without persistent data storage
