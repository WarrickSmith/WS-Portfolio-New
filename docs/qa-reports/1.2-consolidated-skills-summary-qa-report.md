### ⚠️ MINOR ISSUES IDENTIFIED

#### Issue 1: Missing Technical Specifications

- **Missing**: Star rating system for skills (AC3)
- **Missing**: Years of experience calculation (AC4)
- **Missing**: Learning adaptability examples (AC5)

#### Issue 2: Data Model Mismatch

- **Current**: Simple consolidation of existing data
- **Expected**: Enhanced data structure with calculated fields

#### Issue 3: Component Naming

- **Current**: "ConsolidatedSummary" displays sections separately
- **Expected**: More integrated/synthesized presentation
