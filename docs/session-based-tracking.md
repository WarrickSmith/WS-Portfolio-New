# Session-Based Visitor Tracking Fix

## ✅ Issue Fixed: Duplicate Emails on Refresh

**Problem**: The visitor tracker was sending emails on every page refresh instead of once per browser session.

**Root Cause**: The `useEffect` hook in `VisitorTracker.tsx` had `trackVisitor` in its dependency array, causing it to re-run on every component re-render.

**Solution**: Changed the dependency array from `[trackVisitor]` to `[]` (empty array), ensuring the tracking only runs once per browser session.

## 🔄 How It Works Now

### Before (Buggy):

- Email sent on every page refresh
- Multiple emails for same visitor within 5 minutes
- Violated rate limiting intent

### After (Fixed):

- Email sent **once per browser session**
- Refreshing page won't trigger duplicate emails
- Rate limiting works as intended (5-minute window)
- New browser tab = new session = new email (expected behavior)

## 🧪 Testing the Fix

### Test 1: Same Session

1. Open your portfolio in a browser tab
2. **Email should send once**
3. Refresh the page (F5 or Ctrl+R)
4. **No additional email should send**

### Test 2: New Session

1. Open your portfolio in a browser tab
2. Email sends as expected
3. Close the browser tab completely
4. Open a new tab and visit portfolio
5. **New email should send** (new session)

### Test 3: Rate Limiting Still Works

1. Open portfolio → email sends
2. Within 5 minutes, open in incognito/private mode
3. **No email should send** (rate limited by IP)

## 🔍 Verification

You can verify the fix is working by:

- Checking browser console: should show "VisitorTracker Status" only once per session
- Monitoring email frequency: should be once per browser session
- Testing across different browser tabs/sessions

The fix maintains all privacy compliance and rate limiting while preventing the duplicate email issue on page refresh.
