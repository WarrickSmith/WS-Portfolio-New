# Story 1.1: Privacy Content Scrub

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** site owner,
**I want** all personal contact information (phone number, specific address, social media links) and my downloadable CV removed from the website,
**so that** I can protect my privacy and prevent unsolicited contact.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Given the website is loaded, when I inspect the page content and source code, then there must be no phone number present.
2. Given the website is loaded, when I inspect the page content and source code, then there must be no specific street address present.
3. Given the website is loaded, when I inspect the page content and source code, then there must be no social media links present.
4. Given the website is loaded, when I inspect the page content and source code, then there must be no link to download a CV.

### Data Models

- **personalData.tsx modifications required**: Remove privacy-sensitive fields [Source: architecture/data-models-and-schema-changes.md#ConsolidatedProfile Model]

### API Specifications

No API changes required for this story - frontend data modifications only [Source: architecture/data-models-and-schema-changes.md#Database Changes Required]

### Component Specifications

- **Follow existing component patterns**: Use existing TypeScript and React functional component approach [Source: architecture/coding-standards-and-conventions.md#Code Style]
- **Maintain existing styling**: Preserve styled-components approach [Source: architecture/tech-stack-alignment.md#Existing Technology Stack]
- **Preserve existing animations**: Maintain Framer Motion animations during content removal [Source: architecture/tech-stack-alignment.md#Existing Technology Stack]

### File Locations

- **Data modifications**: src/data/personalData.tsx [Source: architecture/source-tree-integration.md#Existing Project Structure]
- **Component modifications**: Existing components in src/components/ structure [Source: architecture/source-tree-integration.md#Existing Project Structure]
- **Asset removal**: public/ directory for CV file removal [Source: architecture/source-tree-integration.md#Integration Guidelines]

### Testing Requirements

- **Manual testing approach**: No automated test framework - use browser developer tools [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Existing Test Framework]
- **Visual regression testing**: Ensure existing functionality preserved [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Coverage Requirements]
- **Component-level testing**: Manual testing during development [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Test Organization]

### Technical Constraints

- **TypeScript compliance**: All modifications must maintain TypeScript 4.9.3 compatibility [Source: architecture/tech-stack-alignment.md#Existing Technology Stack]
- **React 18.2.0 patterns**: Follow existing React functional component patterns [Source: architecture/tech-stack-alignment.md#Existing Technology Stack]
- **Build process unchanged**: Vite 6.2.3 build process must remain functional [Source: architecture/tech-stack-alignment.md#Existing Technology Stack]

### Testing

**Testing Standards from Architecture:**

- **Test file location**: In-browser testing during development [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Location]
- **Test standards**: Manual testing with browser developer tools [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Framework]
- **Testing frameworks and patterns**: Component-level manual testing approach [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Test Organization]
- **Specific testing requirements**: Visual inspection of all existing components and animations to ensure no regression [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Regression Testing]
