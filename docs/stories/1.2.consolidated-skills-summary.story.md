- **Build Tool**: Vite 6.2.3
- **No external dependencies** beyond existing project stack

## Risk Assessment

- **Low Risk**: Frontend-only changes, no API dependencies
- **Medium Risk**: Data migration accuracy
- **Mitigation**: Manual testing with browser dev tools, data validation checklist

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Manual testing completed successfully
- [ ] Code review passed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Previous components (Experience/Education/Skills) are removed from the UI.
