## Dev Notes

**Key Finding**: The existing `ContactForm` component already meets all requirements for this story. No code changes are required.

### Existing Implementation Analysis

The existing component (`src/components/box5/ContactForm.tsx`) fully implements the required functionality:

- **Form Fields**: Name, email, and message inputs with validation.
- **Security**: Google reCAPTCHA v2 integration.
- **Email Delivery**: EmailJS integration for serverless delivery.
- **User Experience**: Real-time status feedback (Sending/Sent/Error).
- **Styling**: Styled-components with CSS variables.
- **Dependencies**: `emailjs`, `react-google-recaptcha`, `styled-components`.
- **Configuration**: Requires `VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID`, `VITE_EMAILJS_CONTACT_TEMPLATE_ID`, `VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY`, `VITE_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY` environment variables.

### Architecture Alignment

- **Location**: `src/components/box5/ContactForm.tsx` (preserved as-is).
- **Integration**: Already integrated into the `Box5Content` component.
- **Styling**: Uses existing CSS variables and styled-components pattern.

### Risk Assessment

- **Risk Level**: Very Low
- **Rationale**: This is a preservation story. The component already exists and meets requirements.
- **Mitigation**: Thorough manual testing to ensure no regressions have been introduced.

### Story Dependencies

- **Prerequisites**: None.
- **Follow-up Stories**: Story 1.5 (visitor tracking integration) will build upon this preserved component.

### Testing
