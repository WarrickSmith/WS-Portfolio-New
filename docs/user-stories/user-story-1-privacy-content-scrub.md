# User Story 1: Privacy Content Scrub

- **As a** site owner,
- **I want** all personal contact information (phone number, specific address, social media links) and my downloadable CV removed from the website,
- **so that** I can protect my privacy and prevent unsolicited contact.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Given the website is loaded,
- When I inspect the page content and source code,
- Then there must be no phone number, specific street address, or social media links present.
- And there must be no link to download a CV.
