# User Story 2: Consolidated Skills Summary

- **As a** recruiter,
- **I want** to view a single, consolidated summary of the candidate's skills, experience, and core competencies, drawing from the previous "Experience" and "Education" sections,
- **so that** I can quickly assess their suitability for a range of technical and IT-related roles without needing to navigate multiple sections.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Given the website is loaded,
- When I view the main content area,
- Then the previous "Experience," "Education," and "Skills" sections are no longer present.
- And they are replaced by a single, unified summary section that synthesizes the most important information from the previous sections.
