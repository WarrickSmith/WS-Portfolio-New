# User Story 4: Retain Contact Form

- **As a** recruiter or hiring manager,
- **I want** to be able to use the existing contact form to send a message,
- **so that** I have a clear and simple way to initiate contact after reviewing the portfolio.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Given a visitor is on the website,
- When they navigate to the contact section,
- Then they can successfully fill out and submit the contact form.
- And a test submission is successfully received at the owner's specified email address.
